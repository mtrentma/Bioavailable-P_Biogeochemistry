Data from my paper: "Characterizing bioavailable phosphorus concentrations in an agricultural stream during hydrologic and streambed disturbances" published in Biogeochemistry

The files in this folder contain the raw data for grab sample measurements of Soluble Reactive Phosphorus (SRP), Total Phosphorus (TP), Bioavailable Phosphorus (BAP), and Turbidity. For SRP and TP, the derived values are provided (raw absorbance data and calculations can be dug up if necessary). For BAP, the raw absorbance data and calculations are provided. Turbidity values are straight from the turbidometer. 

I utilize publilically available discharge data from USGS gage #03331224 and from a weather station in SDW. Snowfall data was requested from the National Weather Service North Webster office.

"Full dataset" is the entire dataset used in this paper.

Sigma plot data
Regretably, Sigma Plot was used to make multiple figures. Below are the files for those figures 
"Data for storm 1" is just the data from storm 1 used to make figures 3 and 6
"Data for storm 2" is just data from storm 2 used to make figures 5 and 6
"Data for dredge event" is just data from the dredge event used to make figure 4

R data
Figure 7 was made in R.
"data for figure 7" is the data loaded into R for figure 7
"code for figure 7" is the code used to make figure 7
